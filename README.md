the actual bot in an actual place doing an actual thing

## Starting and Stopping the Worker

In order to start the worker, make a commit to master with the file `please.go`
in the `autotick-bot` subdirectory.

If you want to stop the worker, rename the file to `please.stop` and it will not restart
itself on the next round.


## Debugging Locally
You can use the CLI of the bot to debug it locally. To do so, install the bot with the following command:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Then you can use the CLI like this:
```bash
conda-forge-tick --help
```

For debugging, use the `--debug` flag. This enables debug logging and disables multiprocessing.

Note that the bot expects the [conda-forge dependency graph](https://github.com/regro/cf-graph-countyfair) to be
present in the current working directory by default, unless the `--online` flag is used.

> [!TIP]
> Use the `--online` flag when debugging the bot locally to avoid having to clone the whole
> dependency graph.

The local debugging functionality is still work in progress and might not work for all commands.
Currently, the following commands are supported and tested:
- `update-upstream-versions`

### Local MongoDB
If you need a local MongoDB instance for testing during development, use the Docker compose file provided
for development:
```bash
cd dev
docker compose up -d

export MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000"
```
